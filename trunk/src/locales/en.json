However, a 5% commission is applied to the amount won by the banker. So only 95% of the money that you win as a banker is actually paid.\nFor tie bets, if the player and the banker are tied, the bet will be paid 8 multiples. And once the bet is made and the cards start to be distributed by the dealer, you can't change the bet at all. This is a set rule, and you have to wait for the results of two or three chapters each on the banker and player.\nIf the same number of cards appear on the banker or player, each of the two initially divided bankers and players, this is called a banker pair or player pair. In this case, you will be paid 11 times the betting amount. In this case, the pair will not interfere at all with the game, and the game will continue for the banker and player or tie betting.\nThe score calculation for the card is determined by adding, from 0 to 9. 10 and face cards are treated as 0 points and only the last single digit is treated as a score, no matter what many points are added. So one of them wins the game with a high score, and if it's a tie, they win with a tie.",

  "bullfight_rule_1": "It is a kind of casino game that is similar to 'Dorigitgotang(Two Card High Poker)', which is very popular in Korea. First of all, the user bets on the player or banker in the same way as Baccarat.\nOnce the bet is complete, dealer will have 5 cards each for the player and the banker, a combination of 3 random cards, 10 or 20 or 30, and then a multiple of 10 (e.g. 10 or 20 or 30) will be placed at the bottom and the remaining 2 cards will be compared to each other to win. In this case, if a multiple of 10 is combined with any sum of three cards, this is called a Bull.\nHowever, if a multiple of 10 cannot be combined by any sum of three cards, this card is called \"No Bull\", and eventually the largest card among the five cards already received will be compared to each other to determine the winner.\nBullfight games change dividends or losses by 1 to 3 times, depending on how you won or lost after betting on a banker or player, respectively.\nTherefore, the biggest feature of this game is that the fluctuations in dividends and losses are very large.\nIn addition to basic betting, users can bet separately on options such as Banker to Fair, Player to Fair, Banker Triple, and Player Triple.",
  "bullfight_rule_2": "For example, if a user bet 100$ on a banker when he or she has a balance of 1,000$, the betting deposit of 200$ will be withdrawn from the balance together, leaving 700$ in the final balance after betting.\nIf the player becomes BullBull and bets on the bank, the loss dividend rate will triple, so you must pay a total of 300$ in losses, so you must pay a deposit of 200$ separately from the initial bet of 100$.\nTherefore, Bullfight must have a balance of <batting amount×3> to participate in the game.",

Of course, small blinds and big blinds work the same way.\n\n2. All players receive two hole cards.\n\n3. The bet will go clockwise from the left side of the big blind. This betting round is called 'free flop.'\n\n* You can take the following actions:\nCall : Pay the same amount as the big blind.\nRaise : Raise the stakes. It doesn't matter how much you raise if it's more than twice the amount of Big Blind.\nFold : Die. Instead of paying no money, you can't participate in this game.\n\nIf the person in front of you did 'Raise',\"\nCall : Pay the amount of the stake raised by the previous person.\nRaise : Even if someone else has already 'Raise', you can 'Raise'(Re-Raise) again.\nAt this time, you have to raise at least the amount that the other person raised.\nFold : Die.\n\nIf everyone except one person 'folds', the game is over in FreeFlap.\nIf more than one person reacts and there is no 'Raise' again, we move on to the next betting round.\n\n4. If you're done betting on PreFlop, three out of five community cards will be opened at once, and the remaining players will play a betting round.\nThis turn is called a 'Flop'.\n\n* You can take the following actions:\nCheck : Turn over your turn without betting.\nIn PreFlop, it was impossible to 'Check' because 'Blind' itself was treated as a bet.\nBut after Flop, it's different. If no one bets, you don't have to bet on it, you can turn it over to 'Check'.\nBet : Bet the desired amount. Any amount above 'Big Blind' is fine.\nFold : Die. It's possible due to the rule, but you don't have to fold it as long as it's possible to 'Check'.\nIf someone bets, you can Call/Raise/Fold again.\nJust like the PreFlop, if there's only one person left, the person takes the money.\nIf there are more than one person left, move on to the 'Turn'.\n\n5. The community card's fourth card will open, and the betting round will begin again. This turn is called a 'Turn'.\nThe action you can do is the same as Flop, and if you still have more than one player left, you move on to River.\n\n6. The last card of the Community Card will be opened, and the final betting round will be held.
