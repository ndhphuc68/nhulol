However, a 5% commission is applied to the amount won by the banker. So only 95% of the money that you win as a banker is actually paid.\nFor tie bets, if the player and the banker are tied, the bet will be paid 8 multiples. And once the bet is made and the cards start to be distributed by the dealer, you can't change the bet at all. This is a set rule, and you have to wait for the results of two or three chapters each on the banker and player.\nIf the same number of cards appear on the banker or player, each of the two initially divided bankers and players, this is called a banker pair or player pair. In this case, you will be paid 11 times the betting amount. In this case, the pair will not interfere at all with the game, and the game will continue for the banker and player or tie betting.\nThe score calculation for the card is determined by adding, from 0 to 9. 10 and face cards are treated as 0 points and only the last single digit is treated as a score, no matter what many points are added. So one of them wins the game with a high score, and if it's a tie, they win with a tie.",

  "dragontiger_rule_1": "Dragon Tiger is a game that determines victory or defeat with just one card, and the game proceeds fastest than any other game offered in the casino, and the game rules are also very simple.\nFirst of all, the place where customers can bet is Dragon or Tiger.\n&lt;It's the same way you bet on either a player or a banker in a traditional baccarat.&gt;\nEach Dragon and Tiger will receive only one card, and the highest number of cards received by both sides will win.",
  "dragontiger_rule_2": "&lt;The rank of the cards is K → Q → J → 10 → 9 → ······A, and so the highest number is K and the lowest number is A.&gt;",
  "dragontiger_rule_3": "In addition, customers can bet on Tie, and if the Dragon and Tiger receive the same card, they will be allocated 8 times the betting amount.\nIf the dragon and Tiger receive the same card without betting on the tie, the customer gets only ½ of the bet back.",

  "holdemRule": "1. The person sitting on the left side of the dealer position will pay for the small blind and the person sitting on the left will pay for the big blind.\nDealer position moves to the left every game. Of course, small blinds and big blinds work the same way.\n\n2. All players receive two hole cards.\n\n3. The bet will go clockwise from the left side of the big blind. This betting round is called 'free flop.'\n\n* You can take the following actions:\nCall : Pay the same amount as the big blind.\nRaise : Raise the stakes. It doesn't matter how much you raise if it's more than twice the amount of Big Blind.\nFold : Die. Instead of paying no money, you can't participate in this game.\n\nIf the person in front of you did 'Raise',\"\nCall : Pay the amount of the stake raised by the previous person.\nRaise : Even if someone else has already 'Raise', you can 'Raise'(Re-Raise) again.\nAt this time, you have to raise at least the amount that the other person raised.\nFold : Die.\n\nIf everyone except one person 'folds', the game is over in FreeFlap.\nIf more than one person reacts and there is no 'Raise' again, we move on to the next betting round.\n\n4. If you're done betting on PreFlop, three out of five community cards will be opened at once, and the remaining players will play a betting round.\nThis turn is called a 'Flop'.\n\n* You can take the following actions:\nCheck : Turn over your turn without betting.\nIn PreFlop, it was impossible to 'Check' because 'Blind' itself was treated as a bet.\nBut after Flop, it's different. If no one bets, you don't have to bet on it, you can turn it over to 'Check'.\nBet : Bet the desired amount. Any amount above 'Big Blind' is fine.\nFold : Die. It's possible due to the rule, but you don't have to fold it as long as it's possible to 'Check'.\nIf someone bets, you can Call/Raise/Fold again.\nJust like the PreFlop, if there's only one person left, the person takes the money.\nIf there are more than one person left, move on to the 'Turn'.\n\n5. The community card's fourth card will open, and the betting round will begin again. This turn is called a 'Turn'.\nThe action you can do is the same as Flop, and if you still have more than one player left, you move on to River.\n\n6. The last card of the Community Card will be opened, and the final betting round will be held. This turn is called a 'River'.\nAfter the bet at River, if there are more than one players left, 'Showdown'.\nFinally, the player who bet/laced will reveal his or her card, and the player with the highest rank will win.",
  "holdemRank": "1. High card: If no other rank is established. The top 5 cards will be your rank.\n\n2. One pair: If two cards have the same number.\n\n3. Two Pairs: If there are two pairs, they will be 'two pairs'.\n\n4. Three of a Kind (Triple): If three cards have the same number.\n\n5. Straight : If the number of five cards is continuous. The lowest straight line is A-2-3-4-5, and the highest straight line is 10-J-Q-K-A. Backstraight is not accepted.\n\n6. Flush: If all five cards have the same pattern.\n\n7. Full house: Triple and one pair exist at the same time.\n\n8. Four of a Kind: If four cards have the same number.\n\n9. Straight flush: If the number of five cards is continuous and the pattern is all the same.\n(10-J-Q-K-A straight flush is called 'royal straight flush' and is the most powerful rank in poker.)",
